# CONTROLLING HOME APPLIANCE WITH TAH


[ Image of TAH and Relay Shield final demo ]

**TAH** is a **Open Source Bluetooth Low Energy** Development platform compatible with Arduino.
The **TAH** is a very powerfull device for controlling the your **Electrical Home Appliances** remotely from your Smart Phone. To control the electrical Home Appliances which works at 120 VAC or 230 VAC over a bluetooth using **TAH Relay Shield**.
This is an great application designed for Home Automation , you can simply automate your Home with TAH board and TAH Relay Shield.

This is very intresting tutorial i hope you would love it !!!!!

## Materials Required

* **TAH board**.
* TAH Relay Shield.
* 9VDC or 12VDC Adaptor @ 1A
* Electrical Bulb.
* Electrical Wires.
* Mains Socket.
* PC/Laptop with Arduino IDE [1.1.0.5](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc2) Installed.
* Your Smart Phone

[Images of All The materials]

## Step : 1 

Note : While Working with Electrical appliances be carefull while connecting to TAH Relay Shield.

Follow the Step wise guid as follows to help you to control the home appliances from your Smart Phone over the Bluetooth Low Energy.

Here in I will give you some details about Relay Shield.
In the given relay Shield we have 5VDC, 2-SUN HOLD relays with their on board driver circuit which can be controlled by the **TAH board** using your Smart Phone and you could easily control your Home Appliances.

## Step : 2
 
Now we will do the Electrical Connections carefully. Here I will be controlling the Electrical bulb with **TAH Relay Shield** .
Just follow the Electrical connection diagram as shown below.

To understand about relays [Click here](http://homemadecircuitsandschematics.blogspot.in/2012/01/how-to-understand-and-use-relay-in.html)

## Step : 3

Wiring connections with TAH relay Shield and electrical bulb.
device to be controlled has to be connected in the series with relay shield as shown below.

[Images of Hardware Connections of bulb and relay shield ]

## Step : 4

Once we done with Hardware and electrical connections, now we will move forward towards the Software part of it.

Here we are going to control the electrical Lamp using TAH and Smart Phone remotely over a Bluetooth Low Energy.
First Download the **TAH library** from [here](http://www.tah.io/start.html) and install it in your existing Arduino IDE to get started.
Under the IOS and Linux Ubuntu copy the library to path **/usr/share/arduino/libraries**.
Download the app for controlling the relays from [here](http://www.tah.io/start.html).

## Step : 5 

Now just compile the **TAH Sketch** and upload it to TAH by just plugin it into your pC/Laptop.
Then just insert the **TAH board on TAH relay Shield and power up the relay shield with adaptor.

## Step : 6 

Now just follow these basic Steps to get it working with your basic Home Automation project.

* Open the **Relay Control** app in your Smart Phone.
* Scan for the Bluetooth Devices.
* Connect with **TAH**
 
Now Start Enjoying the Home Automation Done by you.

# ELECTRONIC DICE WITH TAH

[Image of Dice]

**TAH** is a **Bluetooth Low Energy Open Source** Development platform compatible with Arduino.
The **TAH** can be used for designing some intresting projects like **Electronic Dice**. Current status of the **Dice** will be updated in Real Time and displays the numbers on your Smart Phone.

## Materials Required

* **TAH** board.
* General PCB Board.
* ADXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer.
* 7805 Voltage Regulator.
* 3D plastic casing for Dice.
* 9V HW Battery.
* Male pinheads.
* Female pinheades.
* Wire Stripper.
* Soldering Gun and Soldering Metal.
* PC/Laptop with Arduino IDE 1.1.0.5 Installed.
* Your Smart Phone
* Download the app for Electrons Dice.To Download [Click Here](http://www.tah.io/start.html)


[Images of all Materials]

## Step : 1

Now lets begin with to creating your first Electronics Dice.Lets collect all the materials required to design the Electronics Dice.

Cut the PCB as per your design  and solder the  male and female pinheads as shown in the image below.
 To interface 3-Axis Accelerometer with **TAH** use with analog pins of the **TAH** here i am using A2,A3,A4 analog channels to read the positions of the X,Y and Z axis  of Co-ordinates. please refer the datasheet for Accelerometer ADXL335 [Click here](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/adxl335.pdf)

[Images Circuit Diagram]

## Step : 2

Connect the LM 7805 voltage regulator to step down and regulate the constant 5V DC with filter capacitors for **TAH board** because our **TAH board** needs constant 5VDC supply.
 
Onces we have done with **TAH** Hardware setups and Interfacing circuit with **TAH** shown in the images above.
Now download the **TAH** Open Source library for the board to get working with your Smart Phone.
To Download the **TAH** library from [here.](http://www.tah.io/start.html)

 [Soldered PCB Board]
## Step : 3

**TAH** is uses the Bluetooth Low Energy module to communicate with your Smart phone.
To see the change in the Electronics Dice Status on your Smart phone you need to download the app for **Electronics Dice** from the app store [here](http://www.tah.io/start.html).

Once you have Downloaded all the Software files, Compile the Sketch for Electronics Dice in the Arduino IDE 1.1.0.5.

## Step : 4

Follow the steps to see the Electronics Dice Status in your Smart Phone.

* Download the app for Electronics Dice on app store [here](http://www.tah.io/start.html)
* Open the TAH DICE app in your Smart Phone.
* Scan for the Bluetooth Devices.
* Connect with **DICE**

Now Start enjoying numbers from Electronics Dice.
